# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio. In this project, we are using unsupervised machine learning algorithms to group the cryptocurrencies.
